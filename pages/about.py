    ## üìà What We Offer
    Our app provides several functionalities to help you understand and predict diamond prices:
    
    ### 1. Load Datas
    Easily load your own dataset in CSV, Excel, or JSON format. You can also choose to use our preloaded dataset for a quicker setup.
    
    ### 2. Use Our Best Models
    Leverage our pretrained machine learning models to predict the price of a diamond based on its features. Simply input the diamond's characteristics and receive an estimated market value.

    ### 3. Get Diamond Similarity
    Find diamonds similar to your specified characteristics to understand their value and market trends. This feature helps you compare and analyze diamonds based on key attributes like cut, color, clarity, and carat.

    ### 4. Use Your Trained Model
    Train your own model using your dataset. Select from various machine learning algorithms to tailor the prediction model to your specific needs. Our app guides you through the process of training and deploying your custom model.

    ### 5. Predict with Trained Model
    Once you've trained your model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. This feature is especially useful for applying your custom-trained model to different datasets and scenarios.

    ## üîç How It Works
    ### Load Datas
    - **Upload Your Dataset**: Click on the upload button to upload your dataset in CSV, Excel, or JSON format.
    - **Use Preloaded Dataset**: Choose our preloaded dataset if you don't have your own data.
